LR9 is a kind of time-honored treasure, and it is the Bible of modern office workers. 
It can destroy old cognition and reconstruct biological brain/neurals/mentality... more details will come soon. 
These will give you unprecedented insight and creativity.

This theory(LR9) integrates philosophy, methodology, practice, human and other factors. These modes can be applied into omni-aspect of industry, even lifestyle. And it is a very old technology. This system will enable you to show your strength at anytime and anywhere. 

The new version is evolving, and the known theories have been practiced for decades. Of course, the reason behind these theories or their fundamental existence is the sweat of many predecessors, but today, I use simpler language and modality to transform them into more object-oriented languages.

It may be similar to the book of changes, which is also known as 易经 in chinese.
here is an interesting tips:
<i>所谓太极生两仪，两仪生四象，四象生八卦
The so-called Tai Chi begets Liangyi, Liangyi begets Sixiang, and Sixiang begets Bagua. Hide everything in these divinatory symbols.
Here, the meaning of divination is popularized first. The content of the Sutra is composed of "divination", which has a total of 64 divinations. Each hexagram consists of six layers, and each layer is called "爻 y á o". Each "Yang" is represented by a long horizontal line "-", which is called "Yang"; Or two broken horizontal lines "--" represent Yin, which is called "Yin". From the lowest level, there are a total of Liuxiang, and Liuxiang forms 64 different combinations with different Yin and Yang.</i>

Before we start, we have redefined a new concept, and inadvertently optimizes this abstract understanding.
